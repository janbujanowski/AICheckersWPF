# AICheckersWPF
First project with Artificial Inteligence - based on knowledge from studies, neural networks, genetics etc.

So the project works (not 100% correctly), but it has issues with recurrencing moves and needs restructurizing. 
Ideally you should be able to add your new AI by implementing correct interface. Currently available are random, and minmax.
Please be aware that there is some bug with display when you attemp a recurrencing move, which will be fixed one day.
